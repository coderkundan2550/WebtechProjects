                    Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva,Shiva is also Mahadev.
                    Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma
                    and Vishnu. In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and
                    transforms the universe. In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess
                    (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of
                    Shiva. Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta
                    tradition of Hinduism.

                    The word rudraksha is derived from two words ‚Äì rudra (‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞) and aksha (‡§Ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑).
                    A. Aksha means eye. Rudra and aksha means the one who is capable of looking at and doing everything
                    (for example, the third eye). Aksha also means axis. Since the eye can rotate on one axis, it too is
                    known as aksha.
                    B. Rudra means the one who weeps. A (‡§Ö) means to receive and ksha (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) means to give. Hence, aksha
                    (‡§Ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) denotes the ability to receive or give. Rudraksha is the one that has the ability to wipe our
                    tears and provide happiness.
