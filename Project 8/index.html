            <div class="content1">
                A stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the
                country, India Gate is one of the landmarks of Delhi. Built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the
                first of its kind in the national capital. The walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names
                of 13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000
                soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. The base of the monument is made of red
                Bharatpur stones and the structure of India Gate is similar to France's Arc- de- Triomphe.
                <br><br>
                India Gate is fringed by lush well-maintained lawns that act as a popular picnic venue for families. The
                best time to visit this monument is at night when it is bathed in soft golden lights and glistens in the
                dark star-less sky.
                <br><br>
                The foundation stone of this grand monument was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was
                designed by Edwin Lutyens. A decade later, the monument was dedicated to India by the then viceroy, Lord
                Irwin.

                History. Varanasi is a city in Northern India also known as Benares or Kashi. The city is one of the
                oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is not only the spiritual capital of India, but
                also the holiest of seven sacred cities in Hinduism, and it played a significant role in the development
                of Buddhism.
                <br><br>
                Varanasi is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was
                built by the god Shiva. Because of this direct connection with Shiva, one of the most important gods in
                Hinduism, Varanasi is considered one of the holiest cities in Hinduism.
                <br><br>
                Varanasi is famous for its production of silks and brocades with gold and silver threadwork. A renowned

            <div class="content9">
                The Ganges river in India is more than 2,500km long and has the most populated river basin in the world.
                <br><br>
                Hundreds of millions of people and a huge range of wildlife rely on the river Ganges. But pollution,
                dams and removal of too much water (mostly for agriculture) have affected the flow and health of this
                vital river.
                <br><br>
                One of the river’s most at-risk animals is the Ganges river dolphin. There used to be tens of thousands
                of them, but now only around 1,200-1,800 are left in the river. Biggest threats to them include fishing
                (they’re targeted for their oily blubber), as well as toxic pollution, dams and barrages in the river.
                <br><br>
                The River Ganges (or Ganga) flows from the Himalayas all the way to the Bay of Bengal, through some of
                Asia’s most densely-populated regions. Its river basin is more than 1 million sq km, and home to over
                650 million people.
